# On-OFF-System- 
Objective : design On off system using relay and transistor and pushbutton and other electronics components with arduino 
when we pressed the button the LED will trun ON and when we pressed it again the LEd will turn OFF 
used components: - Arduino Uno R3 - (1K) ohm resistor - NPN transistor (BJT) - Relay SPDT - diode - pushbutton - Blue LED - 9V battery
